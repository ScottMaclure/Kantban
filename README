How to start make this project work in eclipse after you check it out:

# If you don't have the maven play module installed yet:
$ play install maven

Add the maven dependency to your conf/dependencies.yml

    - play -> maven head

Then: 
cd $wherever/project
./init-play

This could take a while if you haven't done this before on this computer.

Start Eclipse
Import 'existing project into workspace'
Right-click project, select Team->Share Project, Select GIT

Boiler-plate for Play projects:

.gitignore
init-play
README
